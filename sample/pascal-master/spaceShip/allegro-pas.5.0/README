Introduction
============

  Allegro.pas is a wrapper to allow Pascal compilers (such as Free Pascal)
  to use the Allegro library.

  Note that Allegro 5 is wholly *incompatible* with Allegro 4 and earlier
  versions, and so is Allegro.pas, but both may be installed at the same time
  without conflicts.

  This is a WIP (alpha) version of the Allegro.pas 5 version.  It is released
  to show what's done and to allow developers to test it and give feed back.
  DON'T USE IT FOR FINAL USE, in this case use Allegro.pas 4.4 version, which
  is the latest stable version released.  Please go to the Allegro.pas' project
  site at sourceforge for more information.

  Current version was tested only on GNU/Linux + Free Pascal.  An earlier SVN
  version was tested while development by a volunteer in Windows + Delphi but I
  can't grant it will work.  Other operanting systems and compilers weren't
  tested.

  The goal is to make Allegro.pas 5 compatible with any operating system
  supported by Allegro, which are Windows, Linux, MacOS and iOS.  AFAIK all
  these OS have Pascal compilers.

  As this is a WIP alpha version, you should remember that at the moment not
  all functionality are implemented.

Implemented
-----------

  + Event manager, including but not limited to keyboard, mouse, timer and
    display.

  + OpenGL support (except extensions).

  + Software bitmaps.

  + Text drawing.

  + Transformations.

Partially implemented or need more testing
------------------------------------------

  * Primitive drawing.

  * Audio samples and streams.

  * Native dialogs.

  * ttf fonts.


Unimplemented
-------------

  - OpenGL extensions.

  - kcm audio.

  - Custom memory management.

  - Phys file system.

  - Demonstration game.

  You can read more about this at the "docs/internal" subdirectory.

============
Installation
============

  First you must install Allegro itself.  Current Allegro.pas version is
  compatible with version 5.0.x only so DON'T install verision 5.1.x.  Visit
  Allegro's project website at http://alleg.sf.net/ to download it.  The
  package includes installation instructions.

  Then you need a Pascal compiler.  At the moment only Free Pascal and Delphi
  were tested but may be other compilers (such as GNU/Pascal) can be used too.

  Each combination of compiler and operating system may need different
  configuration so if it doesn't compile open file "lib/allegro.cfg" and modify
  it.  REMEMBER what do you change and let me know it so I can add it in future
  releases.



=============
Documentation
=============

  At the moment the public documentation isn't complete.  Since symbols have
  same name than the C version you can use the original Allegro documentation.

  BTW I've put some information at the docs/internal subdirectory.  Read it
  specially if you're planning to write or hack your own test programs.
